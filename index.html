                <u><strong>Goal</strong></u>
                <br>
                This research aims to reveal the Eurocentric constructions of both modernism and modern architecture by geographically mapping buildings mentioned in traditional histories of architecture as well as contemporary global histories of architecture.
                <br>
                <br>
                The result is a freely accessible, historiographical toolbox that can serve as the basis for a multitude of research on the subject. We hope that it can challenge the current historiographical narrative by emphasizing trans-national and trans-geographical approaches, providing a wider overview of architectural narratives of modernism in the world.

                <u><strong>Method</strong></u>
                <br>
                In order to outline to what extent a Eurocentric perspective on modernism has distorted the recent history of architecture, this project maps the buildings mentioned, analyzed and included as an illustration in canonical histories of architecture dedicated specifically to modernism or those more global that include a section dedicated to modern architecture.                <br>
                <br>
                Using the MapBox API to geolocate and visualize the data, this mapping helps identify what geographical areas and authors have been underrepresented in the traditional historiography and what issues have remained unaddressed in the architectural debate.

                <u><strong>Data</strong></u>
                <br>
                In an initial stage, data has been gathered from the following books:
                <br>
                <br>
                Charles Jencks, Modern Movements in Architecture (Harmondsworth: Penguin, 1973).<br>
                Spiro Kostof, A History of Architecture (New York: Oxford, 1985).<br>
                Fazio, Moffett, Wodehouse, A World History of Architecture (Enskede: TPB, 2006).<br>
                Ching, Jarzombek, Prakash, Global History of Architecture (New Jersey: Wiley, 2007).<br>
                <br>
                Additional books have been analyzed and will be added in further iterations. These include titles before and after World War II, specific histories of modern architecture as well as global histories that contain sections dedicated to modern architecture.
                <br>
                <br>
                Data from these books was recorded manually on spreadsheets. The gathered data can be downloaded here. Note that preparing the data for mapping resulted in discrepancies in both content and structure between the data visualized on the webpage and the downloadable data. In some instances, data columns were separated or merged to map the data entries in MapBox. Beyond the information that is available online, the downloadable data set includes: coordinates, chapter names, count by individual book, in addition to other data points.

                Two filter options may require additional explanation. The “Show Unspecified Dates” filter accommodates projects where no dates were given. The “Built” filter accommodates drawings and projects that affected architectural discourse but were never constructed. Due to the limitations of the mapping platform, only unbuilt projects with identifiable locations were able to be included online. Additional unbuilt projects can be found in the downloadable data and were incorporated into the authors’ analysis.

                <br>
                Mapping Histories is a research project by MIT Architecture and the Global Architectural History Teaching Collaborative (GAHTC), a project founded by Prof. Mark Jarzombek and Prof. Vikramaditya Prakash supported by the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation and managed by Eliana AbuHamdi Murchie. GAHTC has administrative connections to MIT's School of Architecture and Planning and its History, Theory and Criticism Program.Initial research was produced in 2021-2022 in conjunction with researchers from ETSAM and UPM, Madrid, and was supported by a MISTI Seed Fund Grant.

                After analyzing data collected from the textbooks, it was apparent that Western Europe and American architecture remained both overrepresented and drove the narrative thrust of the texts, with non-Western precedent integrated parallel to a Western European canon. For instance, the trajectory of European architecture was typically presented as nuanced and contingent—singularly unique or authorial objects—while non-European and ancient architecture was frequently rendered “vernacular” and treated as an essential representation of culture and context. This was evident in the analysis of buildings as well, where non-European architecture was not treated with the same analytical rigor as European architecture. Compounding the issue, the former frequently lacked important context, including date, location, and architect or patron. When not relegated to “local tradition,” the architecture of non-European countries was broadly regarded as a derivative of European and American building traditions and ignored the reciprocal nature of cultural exchange. By failing to acknowledge the fluidity of aesthetics, architectural style tended to problematically bound up with ethnicity.
                <br>
                <br>
                While these issues tended to be less pronounced in more recent texts, the general pattern of their data conformed to the trend present in the earliest texts reviewed. Although these later texts more effectively addressed the “global turn” in architectural history, the data demonstrated that they continued to inherit historical structures and methods that favored an established Western canon. One technique to ameliorate these issues was adopted by A Global History of Architecture, which provided a survey of social and political history for each century to parallel the architectural narrative.
